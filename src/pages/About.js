                                For as long as I can remember gaming has always interested me, mechanics specifically. This motivated me to push myself to learn as much as I could about every type of game I could get my hands on.
                                Of course this lead to gaming becoming a passion of mine, along with crossword puzzles this is why I enjoy learning exactly why and how things work/don't work the way they do in a programmatic way. <br /><br />
